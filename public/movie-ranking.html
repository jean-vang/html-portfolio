<h1>The Best Christmas Movies According to Jean</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>A film about a kid's innocent wish for his family to disappear. When they accidently leave him behind though this backfires and causes him to have to mature at an accelerated rate so he can defend his house from two criminals, this all makes him realize how much he loves and misses his family and shows him what the holidays are really about. A nostalgic classic movie that can never get old. It is definitely a childhood favorite. It is very entertaining, funny, and creative.</p>

<h3>A Christmas Carol</h3>
<p>Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly old man who is visited by by the ghost of his former business partner Jacob Marley and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come. The true meaing of the holiday is found in the joy that comes from giving to others and celebrating together.</p>

<h3>Love Hard</h3>
<p>A young woman who travels to her online crush's hometown for Christmas but discovers she has been catfished. A cheesy and light hearted Christmas movie with a great plot twist and the perfect amount of romance.</p>
